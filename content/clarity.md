One of the most common comments I leave on code reviews is "I find this
confusing".  Which is not to say that I can't or don't *understand* the code,
just that it either doesn't help me understand itself, or it actively deceives
me.

I think clarity is probably the single most important thing to strive for in
your code, to the exclusion of everything else.  

People often say Go is "simple".  But I think it is the result of simplicity
that is more important than the simplicity itself.  The result is clarity.  Go
code is more comprehensible than most other languages.  You can still right
confusing, obfuscated code, but the language itself won't help you do it, and
any 5 lines of code is generally entirely understandable even by a Go newbie.
